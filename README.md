# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

Project 1
A simple binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input and also the "crawler" function that will locate data inside of it.

Project 2
A chess function for a knight that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

Both projects from [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lnav) Ruby track.
